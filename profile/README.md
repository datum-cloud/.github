At Datum, we are on a mission to connect the top 1-2k technology producers, providers, and consumers (PPC's) with the ecosystems that power their advantage. 

## Our focus
To make our vision possible we’re building a network cloud that you can take anywhere, backed by open source. Key features include:

- Traffic management with service chainning to offload Internet and app traffic and route securely in private, controlled paths to clouds, SaaS services or other destinations
- Flexible ways to bring traffic into the Datum Network Cloud, including authoritative DNS, built in global proxy / LB, DDoS filtering, GRE or IPSec tunnels and more
- Leverage Datum’s global managed cloud for data plane or bring your own cloud (BYOC) zones via a standard Kubernetes operator deploy model
- BYOC zones can be connected to the Datum Cloud control plane for DevOps, observability, authorization control and more
- Partner friendly model that supports deploy, manage and lifecycle of commercial and open source NFV technologies
- Commercial support for partner marketplace transactions that remove margin-stacking on 3rd party technology
- A reimagined interface and data model for private application and ecosystem interconnections
