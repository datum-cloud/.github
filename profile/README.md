At Datum, we are on a mission to connect the top 1-2k technology producers, providers, and consumers (PPC's) with the ecosystems that power their advantage. 

## Our focus
To make our vision possible we’re building a network cloud that you can take anywhere, backed by open source. Key features include:

- A core set of traffic and security services: DNS, WAF, Global LB, Cloud Connectivity, etc
- Available to use on Datum’s global cloud, with scaled network capacity
- Federated (private) availability zones that can be connected to Datum’s cloud
- A partner friendly model that removes margin-stacking on 3rd party technology
- A reimagined interface for private application and ecosystem interconnections
