# Welcome to Datum!
Datum is on a mission to connect people, networks & applications with the ecosystems that unlock their advantage. To make this possible weâ€™re:

- building an infrastructure cloud optimized for network, data, & inference workloads
- reimagining private connectivity for the next wave of participants
- creating open tools & models to help service and technology providers scale, anywhere

If you'd like to learn more about our efforts, please visit [our website](https://www.datum.net). 

## About us
Datum was founded by [Zac Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsmith/) and [Jacob Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsmith79/), cloud infrastructure veterans and open source champions who happen to be former classical musicians. After their last company (Packet) was acquired by [Equinix](https://www.equinix.com/), they fell in love with the power of its neutral strategy and rich connectivity ecosystem, but noticed how cloud-first companies (as well as technology-led enterprises) struggled to access that value and harness it to their advantage. With that, the beginning of an idea was born. 

Fast forward a few years, and Datum is now working to reimagine how global service and technology providers can better connect with each other and their customers. 

## Open source
A foundational part of our ethos is to do work in the open. Here are a few notes to clarify that:

- We're focused on building value around network workloads (OSS and proprietary), networking primitives, private connectivity, & ecosystem discovery 
- We're also developing a control plane for product-led companies called Datum OS (currently private while it matures)
- In response to community and customer feedback, we may offer a variety of hosted services, which inspires our use of a Business Source License (BSL)
