# Welcome to Datum!

Datum is an open source project committed to making it easier for people to build, operate, and scale cloud-based businesses. Our jam is foundational tooling, and we get excited about reducing toil for developers and unlocking new value up the chain.

Areas of focus include:
- **Users & Access** - think data model, access management, and baseline protection against fraud / account takeover
- **Product Experience** - we're looking at things like product catalogs, entitlements, privacy, and agreements
- **Monetization** - imagine a cloud native pricing engine and contract creation and lifecycle management
- **GTM** - quoting? Order management? Cancellations & renewals? Routing?  Yes, please!
- **Management & Reporting** - from "what's my expected revenue next July" to "did we send the SOC2 report?"
  
Right now, we're slinging code and building a community one person at a time ðŸš€

If you're passionate about something we're working on, please reach out or open an issue on one of our repos.
